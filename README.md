- 👋 Hi, I’m @bagdevi
- 👀 I’m interested in coding in perl and shell scripting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects to deal with any kind of sequencing data.
- 📫 If you want a code to automate anything or have a idea that you want to be transfermed into a code, I would love to help you out.
